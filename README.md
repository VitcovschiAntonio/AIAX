# AI Assistant Mobile App

## Description

This repository contains the source code for an AI assistant mobile app developed in Unity. The AI assistant provides speech recognition and text-to-speech capabilities, making it a valuable addition to your mobile application.

## Features

- **Speech Recognition:** The AI assistant includes a robust speech recognition system that accurately converts spoken words into text. This feature opens up a world of possibilities for voice commands and interactions. Whether it's controlling your app through voice or enabling voice searches, the speech recognition feature offers a versatile and engaging user experience.

- **Text-to-Speech:** With the built-in text-to-speech functionality, the AI assistant can transform text into natural-sounding speech. This feature enables the app to provide auditory feedback, read content aloud, or engage users through vocal responses. It's a great tool for making your app more accessible and user-friendly, allowing users to listen to content when reading isn't an option.

- **State Pattern Implementation:** The project employs a state pattern to manage the behavior of the AI assistant. This pattern allows for a more flexible and organized structure, making it easier to extend and maintain the app's functionality. By utilizing state patterns, you can create complex interaction flows and customize the AI assistant's responses based on specific situations, all while keeping your codebase organized and maintainable.

- **Unity Integration:** The AI assistant seamlessly integrates with Unity, one of the industry's leading game development platforms. This means you can harness the power of the AI assistant in your Unity-based mobile apps effortlessly. Whether you're building a game, an educational app, or any other type of application, the AI assistant can be seamlessly incorporated into your Unity project.

## Usage

To utilize the AI assistant effectively in your mobile app:

- Implement the AI assistant's functionality within your Unity project by integrating the provided code.
- Configure the AI assistant's behavior using the state pattern. This approach makes it simple to manage various states and transitions.
